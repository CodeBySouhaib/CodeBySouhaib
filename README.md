## A Bit About Me

I'm a full-stack developer who loves building things that actually work (and don't crash at 2am). I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from ISET Djerba in 2025, and now I'm pursuing my Master's degree because apparently, I enjoy student life a bit too much.

I work with ASP.NET Core, Vue.js, Flutter, and PostgreSQL. When I'm not coding, you'll find me kicking pads at Muay Thai training — been at it for almost a year now and I've got a nice belt to show for it. Some people do yoga, I prefer something with a bit more... impact.

I drink way too much coffee, I debug at 3am more often than I'd like to admit, and I genuinely believe that Stack Overflow is a gift to humanity.

## Stuff I've Built

### E-Commerce Platform (PFE 2025)
**ASP.NET Core + Vue 3 + Neon PostgreSQL**

My capstone project — a full-featured e-commerce platform with JWT authentication, real-time chat using SignalR, wishlist and shopping cart (synced in real-time with Pinia), email verification, Cloudinary for image handling, and fully Dockerized. Built with clean architecture because I like my code like my coffee — organized.
